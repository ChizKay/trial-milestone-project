# EXPLORE IRELAND

This is an interactive Website containing basic information about certain parts of Ireland that attract a lot of Tourists. The site has 2 pages and a link to an external site. Both pages are divided into two main sections (one conatining informtion about each County, and the other displaying the Map).

## UX

I aimed for simplicity and efficiency in this design to ensure the user(s) find(s) their way around the website with ease. A navigation bar<em>(dark)</em> conveniently fixed at the top, to take the user to each section of the webpage. A dark themed page beautifully blended in with a great picture of <strong>Dublin City</strong> at night, a <em>nightmode Map</em>, and a <em>dark abstract background image</em> filling the entire page.
